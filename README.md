Ahoy there, fellow pirates! Ever wanted to keep track of those elusive One Piece card prices without breaking a sweat? Look no further! This API is here to help you conquer the Grand Line of card collecting!

## Features:

- **Automated Price Tracking:**  Effortlessly retrieves card prices from [Liga One Piece](https://www.ligaonepiece.com.br/). 
- **Fast and Efficient:**  Utilizes Selenium for website navigation and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for accurate price extraction.
- **Caching Magic:**  Leverages Redis for caching, ensuring snappy response times and reducing unnecessary requests.
- **Dockerized for Your Convenience:**  Sail smoothly with the power of Docker for easy setup and deployment.
- **Friendly API:**  Simple and intuitive API design for seamless integration into your projects.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/card-price-watcher.git
   ```

2. **Set Sail with Docker:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Make a Request:**

   Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/get_price` with a JSON payload like this:

   ```json
   {
       "url": "https://www.ligaonepiece.com.br/?view=cards/card&card=Roronoa+Zoro+%28OP01-001-PAR%29&ed=OP-01&num=OP01-001-PAR",
       "card_name": "Roronoa Zoro (OP01-001-PAR)"
   }
   ```

   And you'll receive a JSON response with the current price!

## Example Usage:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/get_price"
payload = {
    "url": "https://www.ligaonepiece.com.br/?view=cards/card&card=Roronoa+Zoro+%28OP01-001-PAR%29&ed=OP-01&num=OP01-001-PAR",
    "card_name": "Roronoa Zoro (OP01-001-PAR)"
}
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Price:", data['price'])
    print("Card Name:", data['card_name'])
else:
    print("Error:", response.text)
```
